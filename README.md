I am using the wav built-in library in Python to allow the user to edit audio files. My challenge is to not use any non-built-in libraries. My program must: get user input, modify the audio file, play the audio file, and combine different audio files together. These actions will be performed sequentially. It needs to have the ability to work with bytearrays, stacks, and recursion to adequately read and direct the control flow. These will not be directly accessed by the user, but instead will be "behind the scenes." The bytearrays will be for encoding the audio files into usable chunks. The stacks will be for storing these bytearrays in the order in which they were needed by the user. And recursion will be for combining large sections of files together to form new segments.

The pertinent information I have about this project is that it uses user input to create unique WAV file sounds. It is a text adventure using only built-in libraries and employs bytearrays, a stack, and a heap. These are denoted in the import statements (deque, heapq) at the top of the file. The context is that a person named Clara (but her real name is up to user input) is exploring a dangerous facility.
